# Mini_Project_Report2

Firstly, you have to make sure that every file in Group Kam Kai Heng_Report 2 are placed in the same folder.

Next, you can run the ipynb file on Jupyter Notebook.

In case that you did not install OpenCV library on your device, you may use this command line to install:

**pip install opencv-python**

An output image will be created when you had the code in section _"Run and segment all the images in the folder"_:

the image is named as "output.png" which consist of all the segmented result of traffic sign images.

For the last section in jupyter notebook file, _"Test the code"_ section:
it is use to show the segmented result with an original image beside it. 

You may use any images in the _"70 images selected"_ to run the code. Just remember to change the image name on it.

Now you can run all the code and enjoy :)
